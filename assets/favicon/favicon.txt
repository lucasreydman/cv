DESCRIPTION: Documentation for the favicon system used in Lucas Reydman's portfolio website.
This file explains the purpose and usage of different favicon files for cross-platform
icon support, including web browsers, iOS, and Android devices.

----------------------------------------

FAVICON INFORMATION

This folder contains all the favicon files required for cross-platform support of your website icon.

FILES OVERVIEW

- favicon.ico: Traditional favicon used by older browsers and as a fallback
- favicon-16x16.png: 16x16 pixel favicon for standard usage
- favicon-32x32.png: 32x32 pixel favicon for standard usage
- apple-touch-icon.png: 180x180 pixel icon for iOS home screen bookmarks
- android-192x192.png: 192x192 pixel icon for Android devices
- android-512x512.png: 512x512 pixel icon for Android devices (high-res)

HOW IT WORKS

The different sizes and formats ensure your site icon displays correctly across all browsers and devices:

1. Traditional browsers use the .ico file or the PNG files
2. Apple devices use the apple-touch-icon.png when added to home screen
3. Android devices use the android-chrome files when added to home screen
4. The site.webmanifest file (in this folder) provides metadata for Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality

HOW THESE FILES WERE GENERATED

These favicon files were likely generated using a tool like https://realfavicongenerator.net/ or https://favicon.io/, which takes a single high-resolution image and:

1. Creates multiple sizes of your favicon
2. Optimizes them for different platforms
3. Generates the necessary HTML code to include in your website

IMPLEMENTATION

The following code is already included in the head section of your HTML:

<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="assets/favicon/apple-touch-icon.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="assets/favicon/favicon-32x32.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="assets/favicon/favicon-16x16.png">
<link rel="manifest" href="assets/favicon/site.webmanifest">

The site.webmanifest file contains:
{
    "name": "Lucas Reydman",
    "short_name": "LR Portfolio",
    "icons": [
        {
            "src": "android-192x192.png",
            "sizes": "192x192",
            "type": "image/png"
        },
        {
            "src": "android-512x512.png",
            "sizes": "512x512",
            "type": "image/png"
        }
    ],
    "theme_color": "#2563eb",
    "background_color": "#ffffff",
    "display": "standalone"
}

CREATING YOUR OWN FAVICONS

If you want to update the favicon, you should:

1. Create a high-resolution square image (at least 512x512 pixels)
2. Go to https://realfavicongenerator.net/ or https://favicon.io/
3. Upload your image and generate a new favicon package
4. Replace the files in this folder with the newly generated ones
5. Update the site.webmanifest file if necessary

BEST PRACTICES

- Keep your favicon simple and recognizable even at small sizes
- Use a transparent background for .png files when possible
- Make sure the icon has adequate contrast with browser chrome
- Test your favicon on multiple browsers and devices
